		/*Creating Xpath when you dont have any unique Attribute.
		Parent-child reletionship - Define the Xapth for parrent
		
		for example   you need to find a Garnd or grand value and from there carefully drive to desire object 
		by giving the grand grand Xpath and then / tagName till i get to my desired oject
		
		this is an example //div[@class= 'Sdkep']/div/div[2]/div/input  this is for google search box
		
		There is also multiple plaugins and it helps you to get Xapth or Css. One of them is Chro Path  */
		
		
		//>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Interview questions >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
	
		// 1) what is the difference between relative and absolute Xpath?
		
		/*When you pick a spesific elelement or locator it relative path but when you look for the parent of the spesific 
		locator that you picked until you get to the main body, thats colled absolute path
		reletive Xpath does not depend on parent node example //body/section/div/div/div/ul/li[2] */
		
		
		// 2) how to traverse to sibling element using Xpath
		
		/*for example if we have this as an example //body/section/div/div/div/ul/li[2] and we want to get to the li line we and we have 5 five li line
		so in order to jump from li line 1 into li line 3 we have to do the following on the existing Xpath 
		
		//body/section/div/div/div/ul/li[2]/following-sibling::li[2]*/  //div/div/div/ul/li/li/li/li
		
		
		
		// 3) Question 
		
		// Can you traverse from child to parrent and the answer is yes. the way we do it is the following
		
		// ----- $x("//*[@id='u_0_a']/div/div[2]/parent::div") -------
		
		// 4) Question 
		
		/* how to identify element with Text based?
		The way we do it as follows type //*[text()='login'] 
		if you see there is a space before and after the text that you picked make sure you
		mentioned that as well example //*[text()=' login '] 
		or //*[text()=' login'] and lastly //*[text()='login '] */
